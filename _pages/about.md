Hi, my name is Fred Kozlowski. I used to be a mechanical engineer who designed baggage handling systems for airports. I'm currently working on becoming a software engineer. 

My strategy for that is to-

* Work on side projects, like implementing computer vision algorithms myself.

* Contribute to open source projects. Recently I've been trying to contribute to Godot.

* Work on my writing skills. With meeting people in person being currently impossible, I'm hoping through writing online I can meet interesting people and get feedback on my trajectory.

My next big project is creating an economics simulator for D&D. I'll be working on it with a friend.
