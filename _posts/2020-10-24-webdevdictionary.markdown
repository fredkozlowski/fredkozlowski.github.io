I had an urge to learn web development, except the sheer amount of stuff out there available to build a website with was incredibly disorientating. As I went around researching each technology/language/framework, I wrote one sentence definitions of them for myself. I'm putting it here and I will update it as I keep learning.

Frontend - Part of the website the user interacts with

Backend - Stuff on the server

HTML - Holds the content of the webpage

CSS - Makes the webpage have formatting and cool colors

Sass - Makes CSS better and allows you to have variables and logic

JavaScript - Allows your website to have dynamic stuff like animations or interactivity

EJS - Generates HTML from Javascript code, not to be confused with Express, Ext JS, ES6

JQuery - A library that allows you to do things thatâ€™d take a couple of lines of code in JS in a single line

Ajax - Not a technology but a technique that allows you to update part of a webpage without reloading the whole thing

Bootstrap - A library that allows you to make nice looking websites really fast by including HTML, CSS, and JS templates for things

Node JS - Allows you to have your server run JavaScript. Useful because now you only need to learn JS to do frontend and backend development

Express - Simplifies some tasks in Node JS

PHP - JavaScript but old and different. Used for backend

JSON - Data storage format

XML - JSON but worse

MongoDB - Fancy JSON database

SQL - A language for querying a database

TypeScript - A superset of Javascript which adds static typing

Flask - Python backend framework

Django - Flask but with more built in

Terraform - Create and manage a server on AWS / Azure using code rather than their website

Docker - Rather than use a virtual machine, let the apps share the OS without interfering with each other

Angular - A framework which allows you to create reusable components using Typescript for the front end

React - Angular but different
