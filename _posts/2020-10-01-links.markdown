* [This post on salary negotiation by Patrick McKenzie.](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) Thanks to this advice I got $6000 more at my first job.

* [Networking for Nerds by Benjamin Reinhardt.](https://benjaminreinhardt.com/networking-for-nerds/) I've been trying to implement this advice. Let's see how it goes?

* [Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now by Alexey Guzey.](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/) This directly inspired me to start this blog.

* [Meditations on Moloch by Scott Alexander.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) I've chosen this link, but really any of his posts are fantastic. I can't emphasize how incredible this blog is.

* [Archery, Distance and ‘Kiting’.](https://acoup.blog/2019/07/04/collections-archery-distance-and-kiting/) A good look into why archery is horribly misrepresented in games. If you've ever wondered how horse archers actually worked, this has a good answer.
