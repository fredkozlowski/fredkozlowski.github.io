#### What I want to read

* Dune and Dune Messiah - I read Dune a few years ago and I absolutely loved it, but I never got around to reading the sequel. With the movie coming out this seems like the right time.

* Stuff by Nassim Nicholas Taleb - I read Black Swan recently. It was entertaining and had some good tidbits so I'm interested in what else he has to say.

* Inner Game of Work - Inspired by Michael Ashcroft on Twitter. I'm also interested in how this intersects with The Art of Learning.

* Chaos by Gleick - Want to read purely on the recommendation of Sapolsky.

* Contemporary Political Philosophy by Kymlicka- Friend recommended.

#### What I've reviewed recently on Twitter

* The Sovereign Individual
