I've been thinking a lot about the origins of psychosomatic pain. I've had minor brushes with it, just about enough to convince me to take it seriously. I understand that psychosomatic stuff can be *insert adjective* but I'm convinced there's at least a grain of truth in it both 1) existing in more cases than people think and 2) being resolvable through emotional healing.<br>

Asking what you would do if you didn't have a constraint is clarifying because you often realize it isn't a constraint. Money can limit your scale, but probably not keep you from the attempt.<br>

This is a wildly underrated piece on the Japanese political system and how it has a functional one party system. <br>

An interesting story about [watermelons](https://seasonal.substack.com/p/watermelons?s=r), but one part stood out to me - <br>

>In 1924, a National Geographic Magazine writer chronicled his adventures in Sudan from 1916 to 1920, in which watermelons played a key role. He enjoyed watermelon tea the locals made—after punching the fruit open and squeezing the flesh to press the juice out—and, in brutal 110-120F heat, endured a six-week journey on which watermelons were his sole source of water. The writer, Major Edward Keith-Roach, complained about being unable to shave during that trip but couldn’t praise watermelons enough for saving his life and making the trek possible.

This guy built an ML trading system to make $200k from $5k. A little light on the details but interesting nonetheless.

This guy is selling a book on how to get a 4 day workweek. I haven't read the book, but I find myself referencing his blog a lot to people who don't realize you can just negotiate a shorter workweek.

A great summary by Alex Danco about Rene Girard's theories. Much easier than reading Girard directly, trust me.

This is a cool set of comments about soil usage and climate. It's sad seeing people blame meat production for climate change, since it can absolutely be transformed to be beneficial to the planet. Also, modern factory farming is terrible for the soil in more ways than I realized.

Interesting progress in the field of tinnitus. If there's one thing I've learned it's that knowledge in the field of medicine is poorly distributed. Hopefully this can help someone.
