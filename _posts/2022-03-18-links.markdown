I've been thinking a lot about the origins of psychosomatic pain. I've had minor brushes with it, just about enough to convince me to take it seriously. I understand that psychosomatic stuff can be *insert adjective* but I'm convinced there's at least a grain of truth in it both 1) existing in more cases than people think and 2) being resolvable through emotional healing.

Asking what you would do if you didn't have a constraint is clarifying because you often realize it isn't a constraint. Money can limit your scale, but probably not keep you from the attempt.

An interesting story about watermelons, but one part stood out to me -

>In 1924, a National Geographic Magazine writer chronicled his adventures in Sudan from 1916 to 1920, in which watermelons played a key role. He enjoyed watermelon tea the locals made—after punching the fruit open and squeezing the flesh to press the juice out—and, in brutal 110-120F heat, endured a six-week journey on which watermelons were his sole source of water. The writer, Major Edward Keith-Roach, complained about being unable to shave during that trip but couldn’t praise watermelons enough for saving his life and making the trek possible.
