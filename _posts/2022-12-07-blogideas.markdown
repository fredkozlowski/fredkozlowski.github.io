I have a lot of ideas for blog posts - so many that they've begun getting lost in my notes. I figured I'd put them up on here. I'll be very happy if you steal these ideas, I likely won't get around to writing many of these.

* Summary of the Power Broker. I loved this book and I would love to write a great summary since I know many people who would enjoy it but don't have the time for so long a book. This would be a great candidate for an "expandable" style, where certain themes could be expanded by the reader, leaving the core summary fairly short, but with additional and optional detail for areas of interest. I'm thinking of making it theme based rather than a narrative style. See below for Dominic Cummings' request as well. 

>The Power Broker, Robert Caro. About Robert Moses’s grip on NYC. Someone should run a prize for the best 10,000 word essay summarising the fundamental lessons of this book (which I haven’t read in full, just skimmed, because of time not a judgement). Ditto for the Johnson volumes (I’ve not read) when Caro publishes the last. While some lessons are specific to time/place (e.g how the Senate works in 1950) the most important lessons from all such books are quite abstract and common and I assume this will be true of these classics.
