I seem to have this discussion often when I talk with friends. They say their life is ruined because they didn’t get into an elite university. I say you’re 23 dude, chill. This is an attempt at explaining my thinking on this topic. I’m unqualified to speak on this topic, considering I haven’t achieved much. I do have a strong opinion on this topic though. Believing that you're only a product of the college you went to can ruin your sense of agency. Perceiving that you’re in control of your life is an important tool in avoiding depression. I struggled with this thinking throughout college and came up with a way around this problem. This article is mostly addressed to my friends, in an attempt to help them avoid depression and nihilism.

My friends are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. They’re mostly Asian and their parents pressure them into established career paths. Even if they don't say it explicitly, you still feel it subconsciously. The regular American “track” of good high school -> elite college -> good safe career is reinforced.

My friend recently said that if he could get reincarnated he would in an instant because he knows so much more about how college and jobs work. I agree with this sentiment. Having parents that have been through American college before you is like reincarnation. As a high school student, I didn’t have the first clue about what to get into a good college. I defaulted to doing things that were interesting to me and got into Stony Brook University. It’s a very good school, but it’s not Columbia.

If you end up going to just a good school and not a great school, you can start thinking that your life is pretty much over. Sure, there are some opportunities you might be able to get, but who would choose you over someone with Harvard University on their resume? You feel outplayed before you even knew what was going on. Your friends getting crazy perks, internship offers emailed to them, grade inflation. How can you catch up?

Unfortunately, upward mobility isn’t as easy as the American Dream bullshit implies. If you go to a less prestigious college, it’s going to be harder to get a certain job than if you had an Ivy League on your resume. Even ignoring this, elite colleges have a few more advantages. You’re befriending the children of successful people, making your network more valuable. Elite colleges are training grounds for teaching upper-class behaviors. The grades may be inflated and the classes may be better, although not necessarily. There are more programs and financial support for students.

What happens if you want to contribute to the world? What do you do if you want to work at SpaceX? What if you’re terrified of ending up with a mediocre career? It is harder starting as a broke bitch and having a good but not great college on your resume, but it's not impossible. I’m far from having a great career, but at the very least lying to yourself in the way I currently am is much better than giving up.

Having gone to an average school, you’ll have a tough time getting into the prestige driven tracks, like consulting or law. This is good if you aren’t dead set on going into those fields. Fields like those have relatively poor payoffs in exchange for stealing your life. They’re honeypots where you get a high starting salary, but bad long term prospects unless you sacrifice everything. Being kicked off the “standard elite college grad track” can be a blessing in disguise.

I'm still testing the strategies for compensating for a mediocre college experience on myself. Hopefully, they inspire you to do something other than sit on your ass. Resignation means you lose by default. The most important thing to realize is that you’re young and there’s a whole world open to you. You can’t build a startup because you’re broke. You might not get into some prestigious program or work at SpaceX immediately. There are ways to make these things happen though.

You need to achieve something to get a good career. This is a deeper concept than you’d think. The assumption is that once you go to an Ivy League, you can get good grades and graduate with a good job. This doesn’t apply to you. You need to show that you’re competent.

There are a lot of ways to show competency. It’s a combo of building something minimally innovative and marketing it well. That’s what I’m trying to do with this blog. At some point I'll finish a minimally interesting project and can then show it off to potential employers.

There are a lot of open jobs for competent people. Hiring is hard (or so I hear). If you can solve a problem a business has that’s enough. There aren’t a lot of jobs for undifferentiated applicants though. If you have a project where you’ve solved exactly the problem a company has, then you'll have a good shot. As an example, if you’re looking to apply to iRobot (the company that makes Roombas) making a Roomba replica with some new features would be helpful. It’s sure to be better than resume spam.

This isn’t to say that status is unimportant. Signalling competence is much better than having it. Fortunately, you can gain status fast once you demonstrate competence. There are tons of people who didn’t go to college and still did dope shit. Niklas Luhmann wrote books that were retroactively accepted as a PhD thesis and then became a professor. Also, look to literally anyone who didn’t go to college and achieved anything. Once you have something to show, that scales a lot more than just having Harvard on your resume.

My vibe here is that regardless of how true what I’ve wrote is, it’s better than complaining about how hard life is. At least you get some side projects out of this “incorrect” belief.
