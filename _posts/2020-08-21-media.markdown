### Media That Has Made Me Who I Am

Obviously, each of these works influenced me at most by ~0.5% on an imaginary scale. That still is a lot in my opinion for just reading a book or watching a movie. 

#### Books

* Arthur Clarke's short stories - Blew my mind as a kid. Singlehandedly inspired me to learn how technology works and got me excited for the future.

* Matterhorn - There but for the grace of God go I

* How To Be A Victorian - Opened my eyes to how people in the past weren't any different from us today, they just operated under different incentives and constraints.

#### Movies

* Lord Of The Rings - Made me into a fantasy nerd.

#### TV Shows

* Mad Men - The only show where I felt like I KNEW the characters

#### Games

* The Total War series - inspired my love of history
