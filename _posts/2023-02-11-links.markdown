Recent thought loops - zoning and local government (again), political power, and writing

Follow up on my last links post point about sedentary life. [Chairs are fucking dangerous](https://twitter.com/aspiringpeasant/status/1610057475629420545)

My favorite Simon Sarris content that I've read recently

* [The Hidden Storehouse](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-hidden-storehouse) which is about writing and originality.

* [Welcome Ghosts](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/welcome-ghosts) which is a great different perspective on history.

* [Why do people read so much only to get so little out of it?](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1542540263767277569)

I recently went to Japan so I read a lot of Japan related content.

[Craig Mod has walked across Japan - these are his post-pandemic recommendations which rang true for me](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/147/)

[Patio11 finally put together a list of Japan recommendations](https://www.kalzumeus.com/japan-recommendations/)

[Website for industrial tourism in Japan, definitely going to do this next time I go](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33680460)

[Extremely overpriced events.](https://deeperjapan.com/) I would probably not sign up for these, but it's great to see that this is available. Probably the best method would be to try to find these outside of the booking website.

FRED has more statistics than I thought. [Number of Software Development Job Postings on Indeed in the United States.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLCHGUSTPSOFTDEVE)

[What I learned in two years of moving government forms online.](https://medium.com/@jgee/what-i-learned-in-two-years-of-moving-government-forms-online-1edc4c2aa089) Exceptionally important article for anyone musing about how local government works in a general sense. 

[A directory of on-demand manufacturers for your creative projects.](https://buildlist.org/)  Each site listed has instant quotes / online ordering so you can upload your project files and immediately see how much it will cost and how long it will take to make.

[HOW TO LOOK BETTER IN PANTS!!!!](https://twitter.com/dieworkwear/status/1569945983534120960?lang=en)

[Plunkitt of "Honest Grift" fame](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/plunkett-george/tammany-hall/index.htm) Probably the best document to understand the realpolitik of NY government. 

[Craig Mod on writing good newsletters](https://craigmod.com/essays/on_writing_good_newsletters/)

[I love this poem so much.](https://twitter.com/chowleen/status/1572942906637549569)

[The strangest thing that AI could tell you.](https://twitter.com/nosilverv/status/1510082472968691714?s=20&t=yV5wMemMbac1UTk1iFw4Tw) Very thought provoking tweet that I ponder a lot.

[In response to this tweet I have begun mailing people books with a handmade bookmark in them.](https://twitter.com/tttuckerrr/status/1521194851567652864)

[Guy explains road design. 10/10 highly recommend for watching while eating.](https://www.youtube.com/c/RoadGuyRob/videos)

[David Choe hunted baboons with the Hadza of Tanzania.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrbjiOs4no) It's a cool story and apparently it's true? I think the alpha in this video is the portrayal of the Hadza _not_ by a documentary crew.
